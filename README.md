- Hi, I’m @SoshJam.
- I'm a student at the University of Utah.
- I'm currently looking for a new position as a software developer.
- I’m interested in computer programming, web development, and gaming.
- I’m currently learning Rust.
- I'm also working on a video game, you can check it out on Steam [here.](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1937960/Topspin/)
- Email me at sam.hill@soshjam.com to collaborate or contact me.
- My website is [samhillweb.com](https://samhillweb.com) which is built using Next.js. (I only work on it in my spare time, so it's still unfinished.)
